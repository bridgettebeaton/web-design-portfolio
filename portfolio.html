      <p>
        This page is a starting place for my work. Right now I am using placeholder content,
        but over time I will add real projects and links. The goal is to keep this page simple,
        clear, and easy to navigate.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want my portfolio to show the different kinds of projects I can do, like writing, design,
        and digital storytelling. I also want it to feel professional enough that I could share it
        for classes, internships, or future jobs.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I learn more, I will add images, better structure, and descriptions that explain what I did
        and what skills I used. For now, I am focused on building a strong foundation with clean HTML.
